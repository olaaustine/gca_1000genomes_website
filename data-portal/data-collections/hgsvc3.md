The Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC), funded by NHGRI, have built on their earlier work published in 2019 and 2021 exploring multiple technologies for structural variation discovery and 30x short-read data generated by NYGC.

This phase of the HGSVC is in progress and expands to additional human genomes using more complete phased assemblies including longer and more accurate long-read sequence data. Raw pre-QC and unvalidated data can be found on the [HGSVC3 IGSR FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HGSVC3).

This work is described in the publication by Ebert et al., 2021 and Mark J P Chaisson et al., 2019 .
